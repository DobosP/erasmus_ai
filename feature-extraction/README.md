# Feature extraction

## Extracted features:
1. dullness - analysis of proeminent colors in the image
2. whiteness - too bright or too white
3. average_pixel_width	- Average Pixel Width (pixel variation) is a measure which indicates the amount of edges present in the image. If this number comes out to be very low, then the image is most likely a uniform image and may not represent right content.
4. image_size - Too Big Images or Too Small Images might not be very good for generating good attraction. Users may skip viewing a very large or very small sized image. 
5. temp_size	
6. width	
7. height
